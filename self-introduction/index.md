### **Transcript**

Hi, my name is Kseniya and I‚Äôm a junior front-end developer. 

3 years ago, I graduated from Belarussian State University as manager-economist and since that moment I have been working as a financial analyst at JSC MTBank. Recently I moved to Germany, and I thought that this change of living could also bring a good opportunity for a career change.
Although it might seem to be a spontaneous decision, I have to say that I had a few crossings with programming before. While being student, I passed a couple of introductory HTML&CSS courses in Netology School and on LinkdIn Learning platform.  Also, for some periods of time I worked as independent contractor at Epam Systems. There, I dealt with educational projects and I acted either as content developer or content tester. I‚Äôve been reviewing and completing tasks in economy and statistics on different educational platforms, creating presentations for universities based on educational materials, and testing machine-generated audio materials. I really enjoyed that experience of working in the E-learning sphere.

By the way, at that time, I realized that it was really important for me to see the results of my job, and this is one of the advantages of front-end that matter most for me. Also, in my opinion, web-development gives infinite opportunities for learning and growth. In addition, I think I‚Äôm quite meticulous, which, I guess, is a good supporting quality when you face a day-to-day development routine. This is why I think I‚Äôll be able to put my skills into practice with front-end.

Speaking about my pet-projects, I did have one. I realized that I needed a task-tracker with time control for a better time-management. So, I‚Äôve created a small web application where you can add, edit, delete tasks, change their order, put the timer for each task on or pause it. The task list is saved to local storage, so it is always there when you reload the page. The hardest part for me was drag and drop logic and timer setting, but all in all the project is pretty basic.
