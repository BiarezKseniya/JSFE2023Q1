				<h2>Key Concepts of XSS</h2>
				<ul class="unordered-list concept-list">
					<li>XSS: <span class="important">a web-based attack</span> on vulnerable web apps.</li>
					<li>The victim is the <span class="important">user</span> and not the application.</li>
					<li>Malicious content is delivered to users <span class="important">using JS</span>.</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					XSS is an attack where malicious code is injected into safe websites. An attacker exploits a vulnerability in
					a web application to send code, usually JavaScript, to an end user. XSS attacks target the application’s users
					directly, rather than the application itself. In short, XSS vulnerabilities occur when input coming into web
					applications is not validated and/or output to the browser is not properly escaped before being displayed.

					<h2>Types of XSS attacks</h2>
					<ul class="unordered-list types-list">
						<li>Persistent</li>
						<li>Reflected</li>
						<li>DOM-based</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						There are three main types of XSS attacks: persistent, reflected, and DOM-based.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Persistent XSS</h3>
					<div>
						<p class="assertion">Expected behaviour:</p>
						<pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="html">
						&lt;p&gt;Hello, this is my message!&lt;/p&gt;
						</code></pre>
					</div>
					<div class="fragment">
						<p class="assertion">Evil hacker:</p>
						<pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="html">
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;script&gt;/* Bad stuff here... */&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					</code></pre>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						Occur when malicious code is stored on a server and shown to other users.
						Ex: a message on a forum, a nickname in a chat room, or contact details in an order.
						The main idea is that an attacker can send data that attacks other users.
						Ex: a message board application lets users submit messages, which are displayed to other users.
						If the application doesn't perform any other processing of the data, an attacker can easily send a message
						that attacks other users:
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Reflected XSS</h3>
					<p class="assertion">Expected behaviour:</p>
					<p>https://insecure-website.com/status?message=All+is+well.</p>
					<pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="html">
						&lt;p&gt;Status: All is well.&lt;/p&gt;
					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						On the other hand, reflected cross-site scripting involves the immediate return
						of user input. An attacker must trick the user into sending data to the target site,
						which is often done by tricking the user into clicking a maliciously crafted link.
						It exploits the situation when an application receives data from an HTTP request and
						returns it in the response without validation.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Reflected XSS</h3>
					<p class="assertion">Evil hacker:</p>
					<p>https://insecure-website.com/status?message=
						&lt;script&gt;/+Bad+stuff+here…+/&lt;/script&gt;
					</p>
					<pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="html">
						&lt;p&gt;Status:
							&lt;script&gt;/* Bad stuff here… */&lt;/script&gt;
						&lt;/p&gt;
					</code></pre>
					<aside class="notes">
						Ex: If a user visits this URL, the attacker’s script will execute in their browser.
						Generally, search results and error message pages are two common targets for reflected
						XSS. They often send unmodified user input as part of the response without ensuring
						that the data is properly escaped so that it is displayed safely in the browser.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>DOM-based</h3>
					<div>
						<p class="assertion">Expected behaviour:</p>
						<pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="js">
					const search = document.getElementById('search').value;
					const results = document.getElementById('results');
					results.innerHTML = 'You searched for: ' + search;
					</code></pre>
					</div>
					<div class="fragment">
						<p class="assertion">Evil hacker:</p>
						<pre><code data-trim data-noescape class="html">
						&lt;p&gt;You searched for:
							&lt;img src=1 onerror='/* Bad stuff here... */'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						</code></pre>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						Occur when malicious code changes the structure of a page in the user’s browser.
						Ex: an app uses some JS to read the value from an input field and write that value to an element within the
						HTML.
						If the attacker can control the value of the input field, they can easily construct a malicious value that
						causes their own script to execute.

				<h2>XSS Impact</h2>
				<p>XSS vulnerabilities are <span class="important"> one of the OWASP Top 10 security concerns</span> today.</p>
				<aside class="notes">
					XSS attacks can have serious consequences. They are even considered to be one
					of the top security issues by OWASP, especially as so many organizations rely
					heavily on web applications for customer interaction and validation.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Consequences</h2>
				<div class="list-container">
					<ul class="unordered-list consequences-list">
						<li>Account hijacking</li>
						<li>Spreading web worms</li>
						<li>Accessing browser history and clipboard contents</li>
						<li>Remotely controlling the browser</li>
						<li>Scanning and exploiting intranet appliances and apps</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<aside class="notes">
					When attackers succeed in exploiting XSS vulnerabilities, they can gain access to account credentials. They
					can also spread web worms or access the user’s computer and view the user’s browser history or control the
					browser remotely. After gaining control to the victim’s system, attackers can also analyze and use other
					intranet applications.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section id="good-practices">
				<h2>Good Practises</h2>
				<ul class="unordered-list">
					<li><span class="important">Filter input</span> on arrival</li>
					<li><span class="important">Encode data</span> on output</li>
					<li>Use appropriate <span class="important">response headers</span></li>
					<li><span class="important">Content Security Policy</span></li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					XSS vulnerabilities can be prevented by consistently using secure coding practices and ensuring that all input
					is properly escaped. At the point where user input is received, we can filter as strictly as possible based on what is expected
					or valid input. At the point where user-controllable data is output in HTTP responses, we can encode the output to prevent
					it from being interpreted as active content. Depending on the output context, this might require applying
					combinations of HTML, URL, JavaScript, and CSS encoding. To prevent XSS in HTTP responses that aren't intended to contain any HTML or JavaScript, you can use the
					Content-Type and X-Content-Type-Options headers to ensure that browsers interpret the responses in the way you
					intend. •	Also, you can use Content Security Policy (CSP). CSP is a browser mechanism which has a standardized collection of
					directives to instruct the browser which content sources can be trusted and which should be prevented.
					However, the CSP can easily be bypassed if it is not strict enough. Thus,
					CSP should be used as a last line of defense to reduce the severity of any XSS vulnerabilities that still occur.
					XSS flaws can be difficult to identify and remove from a web application. The best way to find flaws is
					to perform a security review of the code and search for all places where input from an HTTP request could possibly
					make its way into the HTML output.
					All in all, although XSS vulnerabilities are a major security concern, they can be prevented by writing secure code,
					testing for vulnerabilities, and using security tools.
