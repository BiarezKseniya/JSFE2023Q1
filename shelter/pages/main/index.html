                        <p class="description">Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands and statistics show
                            that only 20% of them will find a family. The others will continue to live with us and will
                            be waiting for a lucky chance to become dearly loved.</p>
                        <p class="description">We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they do not get
                            sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) and well. We are supported by 87
                            volunteers and 28 employees of various skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by
                            the shelter staff. Taking care of the animals, they become attached to the pets and would
                            hardly ever leave them alone.</p>
